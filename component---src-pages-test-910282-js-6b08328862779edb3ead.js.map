COVID-19 pandemic and the statewide March 19, 2020 shelter-in-place order. These\r\nunprecedented circumstances gave rise to a diverse scope of teaching methods and\r\nadjusted curriculums--ranging from pre-recorded lectures to whole-class meetups over\r\nvideo conferencing. But it begs the question, how can we effectively teach students online?\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nOne teacher who decided to establish multiple teaching methods during the pandemic is\r\nMatangi Rajamani, a middle school teacher at Kennedy Middle School. Ms. Rajamani\r\nteaches both 8th grade geometry and science, and during the pandemic, she came up with\r\ncreative ways to interact with her students. Ms. Rajamani decided to use software such as\r\nGoogle Meet and Google Classroom as the main mediums for learning. If a student could\r\nnot make a certain class time, they could always “show up” on a different day to make it up.\r\nIn addition, Ms. Rajamani put all the class materials on her website for easy access.\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nTo help her students feel that they were back in the classroom with her, Ms. Rajamani\r\ntransformed the room she was broadcasting from into a mock classroom using a\r\nwhiteboard, and a projector to showcase material for her students.\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nOne particular challenge posed by distance learning is how to compensate for no in-person\r\nclass time and hands-on learning. The math textbooks used at the school often go along\r\nwith a set of physical manipulatives that allow for a more physical learning experience. Ms.\r\nRajamani decided to bring some of the manipulatives home to show her students during\r\nher online teaching sessions. Because not all students had printers at home, Ms. Rajamani\r\nwould often drive to students’ homes to drop off the necessary handouts, while making\r\nsure to be safe. Even those brief moments of meeting her students were a welcome rarity.\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nMore extensive problems faced by Ms. Rajamani were adapting her in-class teaching\r\ntechniques to teaching completely online solely using video conferencing and getting\r\ncompetent and comfortable with the technology and software. Many kids felt less\r\nmotivated to learn, and because grades were no longer a concern, they were much less\r\nengaged during class. Especially with the option of turning their cameras off, it was unclear\r\nas to whether students were paying attention or not, and whether they understood the\r\nconcepts. After the first few classes, Ms. Rajamani decided to make it mandatory for\r\nstudents to turn on their cameras. “If I’m putting in the effort and showing up on video. . . .I\r\nexpect the kids to be visible as well,” Ms. Rajamani stated. “I’m not going to be an effective\r\nteacher if I can’t see [the students], because the way I gauge my teaching is by [the\r\nstudents’] expression.” She also had her students use visual cues, like the thumbs up icon,\r\nto indicate that they are following her discussion and demonstration of how to solve the\r\nproblems.\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nAnother interactive method Ms. Rajamani used in her class was asking questions to\r\nindividual students. She made sure to inform students that they would be called on at least\r\none question in advance, which gave them more time to prepare, and also increased\r\nengagement. Students seemed to appreciate hearing other students talk and discussing the\r\nconcepts. At the end of the class, the questions and problems would culminate into a final\r\nconclusion or main takeaway.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div className=\"center imgdiv displayImg\">\r\n  <Image className=\"imgborder center\" src={deskPhoto} rounded fluid style={{ maxHeight: `35vw`, objectFit: `cover`, marginBottom: `8px`, marginLeft: `15px`, float: `right` }}></Image>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There were a few students who struggled with online learning, especially since interacting\r\nonline can feel impersonal. She gave all her students and parents her phone and home\r\nnumbers, so they could easily reach her. For the students that struggled, Ms. Rajamani\r\nwould call home to get in touch with the student, and work together to get them back on\r\ntrack. Ms. Rajamani helped them to overcome the distance learning barrier by focusing on\r\nwhat was holding a particular student back and maintaining constant, clear\r\ncommunication. She found that sometimes students struggled with the constant deluge of\r\nemails landing in their inboxes. For one student, she helped him by giving him different\r\ntemplates and formats for organizing and staying on top of his work. For other students,\r\nshe would send out constant reminders about assignments that were due.\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nOne benefit that Ms. Rajamani felt mandatory shelter-in-place provided was that she was\r\nable to connect with the parents to a greater degree than usual. Many parents were\r\nunderstandably concerned about their child’s ability to learn outside of the physical\r\nclassroom. Ms. Rajamani made sure to keep in touch with all the parents, providing weekly\r\nemails and bi-weekly Zoom meetings to discuss what was happening in class. By the end of\r\nthe school year, Ms. Rajamani was thankful to have talked with the parents because she felt\r\nthat “not only did I have a strong connection with my students, but I also developed a really \r\nstrong connection with the parents. . . .the community that was built this year in my\r\nclassroom was even stronger than what it would have been otherwise.”\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nThe teaching community became even more tight-knit, with teachers helping each other to\r\nadapt. Ms. Rajamani explained that the shelter-in-place order brought the teachers closer\r\ntogether because they all worked to help each other understand how to effectively use\r\nZoom and Google Meet and shared their own homemade video lessons for other teachers\r\nto take a look at. The close bond the teachers forged due to the struggles of required\r\ndistance learning created a stronger connection amongst the teachers that would not\r\notherwise have formed, which was a special, unexpected development according to Ms.\r\nRajamani.\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nAnother surprise that came from online learning was that the students in her class did\r\nmany of the assignments without the driving factor of grades. During the last week of\r\nschool, Ms. Rajamani gave her students an optional quiz, and not only did every single\r\nstudent take it, they also did really well. As Ms. Rajamani said, “To me it was really telling\r\nwhen kids do [the assignments] because they want to. . . .They actually want to learn and\r\nare interested in learning, and whether there were grades or not didn’t matter.”\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nMs. Rajamani wanted to make the last remote class of the school year a memorable one so\r\nshe reached out to her former students in the graduating class of Monta Vista High School\r\nto help her create videos of advice from the seniors to the 8th-graders. Many seniors sent\r\nclips of their advice, and some offered to help with the video editing, which was a lengthy\r\nprocess and lasted late into the night. After connecting with her previous students, Ms.\r\nRajamani feels that although the pandemic has created many barriers to teaching and\r\nlearning, “being online, this opportunity to connect, has been amazing.” As counterintuitive\r\nas it seems, the shelter-in-place order forced her to reach out to students, parents and\r\nother teachers and bond in a new way.\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nAs a final note, Ms. Rajamani gave two pieces of advice for her students: First, “you have to\r\nbe responsible for your own learning. . . .If you don’t understand something, reach out to\r\nyour teacher.” Second, “the key to learning is knowing what you don’t know.” In other\r\nwords, students should be diligent in correcting their assignments, because it allows them\r\nto identify the problem areas they struggle with, and where to focus their attention to\r\nimprove.\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nIt is with many long hours and hard work that the educators and teachers of the\r\ncommunity have adapted to the abrupt change to distance-learning, and Ms. Rajamani is\r\namong those that dedicated her time tirelessly to help her students. The SVCU Youth\r\nCommittee would like to thank her for taking the time to do an interview and talking about\r\nher distance-teaching and learning experience.</p>\r\n\r\n  </Container>\r\n  )}","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/newsletter1-ee4028e67d6b49fecc1c8a4f24609f7d.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/Katie_SutterHealth-ba400975945b395966a7c9036bc3cdfa.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/donations-63b6ee030d4cbfda935a8bba594068b9.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
