These unprecedented circumstances gave rise to a diverse scope of teaching methods and adjusted curriculums--ranging from pre-recorded lectures to whole-class meetups over video conferencing. But it begs the question, how can we effectively teach students online?",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"One teacher who decided to establish multiple teaching methods during the pandemic is Matangi Rajamani, a middle school teacher at Kennedy Middle School. Ms. Rajamani teaches both 8th grade geometry and science, and during the pandemic, she came up with creative ways to interact with her students. Ms. Rajamani decided to use software such as Google Meet and Google Classroom as the main mediums for learning. If a student could not make a certain class time, they could always “show up” on a different day to make it up. In addition, Ms. Rajamani put all the class materials on her website for easy access.",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"To help her students feel that they were back in the classroom with her, Ms. Rajamani transformed the room she was broadcasting from into a mock classroom using a whiteboard, and a projector to showcase material for her students.",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"One particular challenge posed by distance learning is how to compensate for no in-person class time and hands-on learning. The math textbooks used at the school often go along with a set of physical manipulatives that allow for a more physical learning experience. Ms. Rajamani decided to bring some of the manipulatives home to show her students during her online teaching sessions. Because not all students had printers at home, Ms. Rajamani would often drive to students’ homes to drop off the necessary handouts, while making sure to be safe. Even those brief moments of meeting her students were a welcome rarity.",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"More extensive problems faced by Ms. Rajamani were adapting her in-class teaching techniques to teaching completely online solely using video conferencing and getting competent and comfortable with the technology and software. Many kids felt less motivated to learn, and because grades were no longer a concern, they were much less engaged during class. Especially with the option of turning their cameras off, it was unclear as to whether students were paying attention or not, and whether they understood the concepts. After the first few classes, Ms. Rajamani decided to make it mandatory for students to turn on their cameras. “If I’m putting in the effort and showing up on video. . . .I expect the kids to be visible as well,” Ms. Rajamani stated. “I’m not going to be an effective teacher if I can’t see [the students], because the way I gauge my teaching is by [the students’] expression.” She also had her students use visual cues, like the thumbs up icon, to indicate that they are following her discussion and demonstration of how to solve the problems.",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"Another interactive method Ms. Rajamani used in her class was asking questions to individual students. She made sure to inform students that they would be called on at least one question in advance, which gave them more time to prepare, and also increased engagement. Students seemed to appreciate hearing other students talk and discussing the concepts. At the end of the class, the questions and problems would culminate into a final conclusion or main takeaway."),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"center imgdiv displayImg"},o.a.createElement(i.a,{className:"imgborder center",src:p.a,rounded:!0,fluid:!0,style:{maxHeight:"35vw",objectFit:"cover",marginBottom:"8px",marginLeft:"15px",float:"right"}})),o.a.createElement("p",null,"There were a few students who struggled with online learning, especially since interacting online can feel impersonal. She gave all her students and parents her phone and home numbers, so they could easily reach her. For the students that struggled, Ms. Rajamani would call home to get in touch with the student, and work together to get them back on track. Ms. Rajamani helped them to overcome the distance learning barrier by focusing on what was holding a particular student back and maintaining constant, clear communication. She found that sometimes students struggled with the constant deluge of emails landing in their inboxes. For one student, she helped him by giving him different templates and formats for organizing and staying on top of his work. For other students, she would send out constant reminders about assignments that were due.",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"One benefit that Ms. Rajamani felt mandatory shelter-in-place provided was that she was able to connect with the parents to a greater degree than usual. Many parents were understandably concerned about their child’s ability to learn outside of the physical classroom. Ms. Rajamani made sure to keep in touch with all the parents, providing weekly emails and bi-weekly Zoom meetings to discuss what was happening in class. By the end of the school year, Ms. Rajamani was thankful to have talked with the parents because she felt that “not only did I have a strong connection with my students, but I also developed a really strong connection with the parents. . . .the community that was built this year in my classroom was even stronger than what it would have been otherwise.”",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"The teaching community became even more tight-knit, with teachers helping each other to adapt. Ms. Rajamani explained that the shelter-in-place order brought the teachers closer together because they all worked to help each other understand how to effectively use Zoom and Google Meet and shared their own homemade video lessons for other teachers to take a look at. The close bond the teachers forged due to the struggles of required distance learning created a stronger connection amongst the teachers that would not otherwise have formed, which was a special, unexpected development according to Ms. Rajamani.",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"Another surprise that came from online learning was that the students in her class did many of the assignments without the driving factor of grades. During the last week of school, Ms. Rajamani gave her students an optional quiz, and not only did every single student take it, they also did really well. As Ms. Rajamani said, “To me it was really telling when kids do [the assignments] because they want to. . . .They actually want to learn and are interested in learning, and whether there were grades or not didn’t matter.”",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"Ms. Rajamani wanted to make the last remote class of the school year a memorable one so she reached out to her former students in the graduating class of Monta Vista High School to help her create videos of advice from the seniors to the 8th-graders. Many seniors sent clips of their advice, and some offered to help with the video editing, which was a lengthy process and lasted late into the night. After connecting with her previous students, Ms. Rajamani feels that although the pandemic has created many barriers to teaching and learning, “being online, this opportunity to connect, has been amazing.” As counterintuitive as it seems, the shelter-in-place order forced her to reach out to students, parents and other teachers and bond in a new way.",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"As a final note, Ms. Rajamani gave two pieces of advice for her students: First, “you have to be responsible for your own learning. . . .If you don’t understand something, reach out to your teacher.” Second, “the key to learning is knowing what you don’t know.” In other words, students should be diligent in correcting their assignments, because it allows them to identify the problem areas they struggle with, and where to focus their attention to improve.",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"It is with many long hours and hard work that the educators and teachers of the community have adapted to the abrupt change to distance-learning, and Ms. Rajamani is among those that dedicated her time tirelessly to help her students. The SVCU Youth Committee would like to thank her for taking the time to do an interview and talking about her distance-teaching and learning experience."))}},VyQF:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/newsletter1-ee4028e67d6b49fecc1c8a4f24609f7d.png"},jOfg:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/Katie_SutterHealth-ba400975945b395966a7c9036bc3cdfa.jpg"},zwRF:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/donations-63b6ee030d4cbfda935a8bba594068b9.jpg"}}]);
